# Age When Published

A simple Wordpress block plugin that displays the age of a person when a post was published. The age is calculated from a date of birth specified under **Settings > Age When Published**.

I built this plugin/block for a private Wordpress site I'm using as a sort-of diary/digital scapbook for my child. I wanted to be able to show how old they were when each post was written. I initially wrote it as a shortcode but when I migrated to a Block theme, I decided to re-write it as a Gutenberg block.

## Screenshots

Here are a few examples of how it looks on the front-end.

And here's the very basic settings page.
